        This is slightly complex, since multiple arguments may need to be expanded at the same time, possibly leading to multiple branching.
        This is resolved as follows with the help of the cartesian product:
            The sequents of each unexpanded argument are added to the `layers` list:
            - If the rewriting rule requires no branching, both sequents should be contained in all branches. They are therefore added separately (each inside a singleton list) to the `layers` list.
            - If the rewriting rule requires branching, the sequents should not occur together in any branch. They are therefore added together (inside a list of two elements) to the `layers` list.
            Afterwards, the cartesian product of the list is taken, yielding a list of all branches.
            The already expanded arguments are added to each list, and a child node is created for each list.
